## General Information
This is a project I have completed in the past. I am doing it again as a portfolio project to practice using Git, HTML (general & canvas) and JavaScript. The first time I completed this tutorial I didn't fully understand a lot of the JavaScript I was using. Having worked through a lot of the JavaScript modules of my Codecademy course, I feel like I might better understand how this project works this time round.
